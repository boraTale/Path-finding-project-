Designed and executed a comprehensive final project in Java, focusing on graph theory and pathfinding algorithms within a post-apocalyptic world simulation. This advanced coursework involved implementing Dijkstra's algorithm and LARAC for optimal pathfinding, considering constraints like safety and time, across a GUI-based application. Enhanced skills in data structures, algorithm optimization, and applying theoretical concepts to solve complex, real-world problems.
